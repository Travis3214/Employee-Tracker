# Employee-Tracker
  ![Badge for License](https://shields.io/badge/license-MIT-red.svg)

  ## Description
  The goal of this application is to build an employee tracker! Without a good application it can be difficult to keep track of all of the information about your employees. I wanted to build something that makes it easy to keep track and make changes to any important information such as their name, salary, role, ID, and department.
